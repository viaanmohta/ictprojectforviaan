<body align = "center">
India's weather prediction, navigation, and disaster management systems rely 
significantly on various satellite systems, such as GSAT, NAVIC. Each of these 
satellites plays a critical role in monitoring, forecasting, and managing different 
aspects of these areas. Here's an overview of how each of these satellite 
systems contributes
</h4>

<p><h4 class = "city">1. NAVIC (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System) </p></h4>
<img src ="navic1.jpg"
height ="400" width ="1000" border ="2px">
<p><h6>NAVIC, also known as IRNSS (Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System),
 is India's regional satellite-based navigation system. It is similar to the GPS 
system but is more focused on India and its surrounding regions. </p></h6>

<p><h4> Navigation:</p></h4>
<p><h6>NAVIC provides accurate positioning services for navigation across India and 
surrounding areas. It is used in various applications like transportation, aviation, 
marine, and even for mobile communication.The system is used for navigation in
 both rural and urban areas, ensuring accurate location data, which is critical for
 route planning, logistics, and transportation.</p></h6>
<p><h4>Disaster Management:</p></h4>
<p><h6>NAVIC plays a significant role in search and rescue operations by providing
 real-time positioning data, enabling first responders to reach affected areas quickly.
During emergencies, such as natural disasters,NAVIC assists in monitoring 
and coordinating relief efforts, making it easier to deploy resources to the
 right locations.</h6></p>

<p><h4 class = "city">2.  GSAT (Geostationary Satellite System) </p></h4>
<img src ="Gsat 16.jpg"
height ="400" width ="1000" border ="2px">
<h4><p>Weather Prediction:</h4></p>
<p><h6>The GSAT satellites, such as GSAT-6, GSAT-7, and others, help 
in communication for weather forecasting. Although GSAT satellites are not
 directly involved in weather sensing, they enable the transfer of data from
 ground stations to meteorological agencies in real-time, which supports 
forecasting activities.</h6></p>
<p><h6>GSAT-6 and GSAT-7 satellites also provide reliable communication
 services for weather observation stations and disaster management
 agencies, enhancing coordination during emergencies.</p></h6>
<h4><p>Navigation:</h4></p>
<p><h6>GSAT-6 and GSAT-7 are used for communication systems, and they can 
support navigation systems by providing uninterrupted communication for 
navigational operations, such as marine, aviation, and land-based systems.
</h6></p>
</h4></p>Disaster Management:</h6></p>
<h6><p>GSAT satellites facilitate communication during disasters, enabling
 better coordination among authorities and relief agencies. During natural
 disasters like earthquakes, tsunamis, or floods, GSAT satellites help 
maintain communication networks, even in remote or disaster-stricken 
areas.</p></h6>
<h6><p>These satellites are also used in the broadcasting of emergency alerts and 
information to the public, which is critical for evacuation and safety procedures.
</p></h6>
<u>
<p> <H4 class = "city"> Summary of Contributions</p>
</u>
<p><h6>
Navic enhances navigation across India by providing accurate location data for both civilian and strategic 
uses and plays a role in disaster management through emergency response coordination.
</body> 
</p></h6>
<p><h6> 
GSAT satellites support communication systems for both weather forecasting and disaster management,
 ensuring connectivity and real-time information transfer.
</p></h6>
<p><h6>Together, these satellites contribute to India's ability to predict weather, navigate accurately, and
 respond effectively to disasters, saving lives and reducing the impact of natural calamities.</p></h6>
